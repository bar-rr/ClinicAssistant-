## Planned Features (Next Versions)

The following enhancements are planned to evolve the system into a fully scalable, user-friendly, and cloud-ready product:

- **Plug-and-Play Phone Line Integration:** Automatic detection and response to incoming calls when a standard landline is physically connected to the PC. The assistant starts in real time upon call arrival.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard:** A web-based interface that displays upcoming appointments in a calendar-style view, categorized by treatment type. Hovering over a slot reveals additional patient details.
- **Customizable Voice Interaction Settings:** Users will be able to personalize greeting and closing messages via a simple web-based configuration menu.
- **Calendar Data Import/Export:** Ability to import Google Calendar data into the dashboard (pre-exported .ics or .csv format) and export the same back from the interface for backup or migration purposes.
- **Centralized Backup Directory:** All imported/exported data will be securely stored in a dedicated backup folder for easy restoration and data safety.
- **Google Login & Calendar Sync:** Automatic Google sign-in from the dashboard to sync calendars without manual authentication steps.
- **Call Analytics Module:** An analytics section to display categorized call statistics, e.g., appointment-related, unrelated, or requiring human follow-up, with timestamped logs.
- **Secure API Key Handling:** Integration of GPT or calendar APIs through encrypted storage, ensuring that API keys are never exposed to end users.
- **User Account Management:** Dashboard login tied to user-specific accounts, supporting personalized configurations and usage limits.
- **Usage-Based Billing:** The system will calculate and reflect billing amounts based on API usage thresholds, with automated balance adjustments.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture:** The entire system will be designed for deployment on cloud infrastructure (e.g., Firebase, AWS, or Google Cloud), ensuring high availability, scalability, and security.

These planned features aim to make the assistant not just functional, but also professionally deployable at scale across sectors such as healthcare, legal services, and client-based industries.
